            <h3>Brand History</h3>
            <p class="history">Henry Ford built his first experimental car in a workshop behind his home in Detroit in 1896. After formation of the Ford Motor Company, the first Ford car, the original Model A, was assembled at the Mack Avenue plant in July 1903. Five years later, in 1908, the highly successful Model T was introduced. Demand for this car was so great that Ford developed new mass production methods in order to manufacture it in sufficient quantities. In 1911 he established the industry’s first U.S. branch assembly plant (in Kansas City, Missouri) and opened the company’s first overseas production plant (in Manchester, England); in 1913 he introduced the world’s first moving assembly line for cars; and in 1914, to further improve labour productivity, he introduced the $5 daily wage for an eight-hour day (replacing $2.34 for a nine-hour day). Assembly-line production allowed the price of the Model T touring-car version to be lowered from $850 in 1908 (equivalent to about 18 months salary for an average wage) to less than $300 in 1925 (equivalent to about 4 months salary for an average wage).</p>

                <h5>About</h5>
                <p class="model-description">The Ford Mustang, introduced at the New York World's Fair in 1964, quickly became one of the most-loved vehicles in the U.S. With its stylish appearance and low price point, the Mustang became the most successful new vehicle in the U.S. in its first year of production, with over 420,000 models sold. By 1966, Ford had produced over 1 million Mustangs for the masses, who cited the car's appearance as a major factor in purchasing the vehicle. While the Ford Mustang may look different today, nearly 60 years after its debut, it remains a popular vehicle for its style and performance. The 2022 Ford Mustang continues to lead the pack with its classic design, powerful engine options, and state-of-the-art technology.</p>

            <h3>Brand History</h3>
            <p class="history">In 1933 Toyoda Kiichiro founded what later became the Toyota Motor Corporation as a division of the Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Ltd. (later Toyota Industries Corporation, now a subsidiary), a Japanese manufacturer founded by his father, Toyoda Sakichi. Its first production car, the Model AA sedan, was released in 1936. The following year the division was incorporated as the Toyota Motor Company, Ltd., headed by Kiichiro. (The company’s name was changed to Toyota, which has a more pleasing sound in Japanese.) Toyota subsequently established several related companies, including Toyoda Machine Works, Ltd. (1941), and Toyota Auto Body, Ltd. (1945). During World War II the company suspended production of passenger cars and concentrated on trucks. Faced with wrecked facilities and a chaotic economy in the aftermath of World War II, the company did not resume making passenger cars until 1947 with the introduction of the Model SA.</p>

                <h4>Toyota Highlander</h4>
                <h5>About</h5>
                <p class="model-description">Midsize SUVs offer flexible transportation, and the Toyota Highlander is a strong choice in this class. You can configure this three-row SUV to seat seven or eight people, so it's a good choice if you need a vehicle with that type of passenger capacity. Still, while the first two rows are roomy, the third row is a tight fit, even for kids. The Highlander impresses with a cushioned ride that shields passengers from road harshness. It also has one of the more deluxe cabins in its class, with many premium materials and soft-touch surfaces.</p>

                <h5>About</h5>
                <p class="model-description">The Toyota Corolla is a five-passenger compact car sold in two body styles: sedan and hatchback. It offers strong fuel efficiency: up to 32 mpg in the city and 41 mpg in highway driving. You also get an impressive list of standard driver aids, including adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, traffic-sign recognition and forward automatic emergency braking. This Toyota provides the comfort most buyers look for in a family-friendly car, with a suspension that prevents rough pavement from jostling passengers. In addition, Toyota's compact hauler feels well-planted when cornering, and its small footprint makes it easy to maneuver in tight spaces.</p>

            <h3>Brand History</h3>
            <p class="history">The BMW name stands for Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH. BMW was created in 1917 from the Munich firm Rapp-Motorenwerke. The company was incorporated into Knorr-Bremse AG in 1920 before being refounded as BMW AG in 1922. It was the successor of Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG, founded in 1916. 1916 is therefore considered BMW’s founding year.</p>

                <h5>About</h5>
                <p class="model-description">BMW X models reflect typical BMW traits in being the ultimate in Sports Utility Vehicles. This is due to the models still offering incredible dynamic performance, despite their larger, more practical characteristics. In addition, BMW xDrive, which is the official term for BMW intelligent four-wheel drive, ensures added versatility no matter where the road takes you, whether it be on or off-road. The range includes SUVs of all sizes from the entry-level BMW X1, to iconic favourites such as the dynamic BMW X5 and, of course not forgetting, the incredible BMW X7 flagship.</p>

                <h4>BMW 4-series</h4>
                <h5>About</h5>
                <p class="model-description">The 2024 BMW 4-series coupe and convertible offer the same luxury goodness as the 3-series sedan, but they prioritize swoopy styling over practicality with less rear seat room and less cargo space than their four-door counterpart. The 4-series also features a different grille design than the 3-series, likely to help differentiate it from its three-box sibling, but the outcome is a polarizing love-it-or-hate-it design. The 4-series is offered in entry-level 430i and more powerful M440i trims, each with plenty of power. Unfortunately, neither exhibits the sharp handling characteristics we prefer from previous generations of BMW's entry-luxury cars. Although we consider the 3-series to be one of the best offerings in the segment, the 4-series models we've tested haven't delivered as much driving enjoyment, leading us to believe that there are more favorable two-door options amongst rivals, including the Audi A5. Even so, the 4-series' posh cabin and powerful turbocharged engines keep it in the hunt with the rest of the class.</p>
